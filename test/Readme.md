### Testing Environment ###
 One qeury need to test all the apis with their use cases and saved all the queries need to save in the log to test mode So that we can hit and save it for later test. Every api hit on the local need to save in the log of test which is not saved in the test but need to save extranally like copy and paste.

 Hit one time and Test after every time you deploy.
